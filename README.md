# food-app

A prototype of a app made with illustrator and invision to help people learn about food production. 

The topics section gives information about current climate/food issues, the other sections provide information on types of foods, growing/preservations methods and recipes. 

Named app 'Sustanence' as a gentle reminder that food is fuel (to sustain us and all living things)
